    <h1><strong>MY PET</strong></h1>
    <p>My pet's name is Coco. <br>I named her after that 'cause of a show I watched and really inspired me.</p>
    <p>Looking at Coco always reminds me tha every situation I face has <br>
    an end and a teaching.</p>
    <p>Coco being a <em>Cat</em> makes her very active and interractive <br>
    but never take any of her toys while she using them.</p>
    <p>Coco really loves being indoors and playing with her toys.</p>

    <h3>Coco's toys.</h3>
    <p>They include :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Catnip</li>
        <li>Turbo Scratcher</li>
        <li>Teaser Wand</li>
        <li>Electronic Motion</li>
    </ul>
